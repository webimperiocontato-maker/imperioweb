    "q1": "How long until the website is live?",
    "a1": "Essential Website: 5-7 business days. Professional Website: 10-15 business days. Sales Page: 7-14 business days. We agree on the exact timeline before starting.",
    "q2": "What does 'Post-delivery support' (30/60/90 days) mean?",
    "a2": "During this period, we fix any errors and make small adjustments at no additional cost. After this period, we offer an optional monthly maintenance plan.",
    "q3": "Are domain and hosting included?",
    "a3": "Not included in the base price. If you already have them, we use yours. If not, we help you register (from ~€50/year). This way you maintain full control.",
    "q4": "Do I need to provide texts and images?",
    "a4": "Ideally yes, as you know your business. If you don't have them, texts are included in the Sales Page package. In other packages, we can create them as an extra.",
    "q5": "What is 'Technical SEO' and what's included?",
    "a5": "Technical SEO prepares the site to be indexed by Google: sitemap, robots.txt, titles, descriptions, Search Console configured. We don't promise rankings — that depends on several factors — but we guarantee the site is optimized.",
    "q6": "How do revisions work?",
    "a6": "Each package includes a number of revisions: 2 in Essential, 3 in Professional, 5 in Premium Pages. One revision = one round of changes after presenting the initial version.",
    "q7": "What's the difference between a '2-page website' and a 'Sales Page (Landing Page)'?",
    "a7": "The Essential Website is a digital business card. The Sales Page is focused on performance: persuasive copy, conversion structure (CTA, social proof, FAQ), and complete tracking (GA4, Tag Manager, Pixel) for ad campaigns.",
    "q8": "Does the Landing Page include tracking (GA4, Tag Manager, Pixel)?",
    "a8": "Yes! The Sales Page includes GA4, Tag Manager and Facebook/Google Ads Pixel configured, with conversion events (button clicks, form submissions) tracked.",
    "q9": "Can I start with Essential and upgrade later?",
    "a9": "Of course! Many clients start with the Essential Website and later upgrade to Professional or add a Sales Page for campaigns. We adapt to your pace.",
    "q10": "Does the website work well on mobile?",
    "a10": "Yes, absolutely. All websites are 100% responsive: mobile, tablet and computer. It's a priority, not an extra.",
    "q11": "Is there a monthly maintenance plan? What does it include?",
    "a11": "Yes, we offer an optional plan after the included support period. Includes: security updates, backups, small content changes, and technical support. Price on request.",
    "q12": "How does payment work?",
    "a12": "50% to start, 50% on delivery. For larger projects, we split into more installments. We accept bank transfer and MBWay."
